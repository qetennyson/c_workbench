An array is simply a special kind of pointer.

Remember, pointers are valuable because they provide us a reference to an object in memory.
It could potentially be quite expensive to move objects into memory for each time they are needed.
For example, you wouldn't want to make 400 copies of a 20MB object just to do some simple operations on that object.

In the case of arrays, you can use:
* pointer notation to get to array values
* array notation to get to pointed-at values

Character strings and pointers have an important relationship.
By combining pointer notation and array notation you can store and reference character strings more easily.

Lastly, pointers give us access to the heap.  More in ch26.
